<b>GBIF Italia</b> is the Italian National Node of GBIF. Italy joined GBIF as a <b>voting member</b> in October 2025.
<br>
From the outset, the National Research Council (CNR)—mandated by the Ministry of University and Research (MUR) to establish the national node—appointed an initial group of four experts to organize its structure. Following this, several meetings were held with the GBIF Governing Board and various well-established National Nodes. This initial effort led to the development of a detailed short, medium, and long-term plan for the successful establishment and growth of our node.
<br>
The Italian Node began publishing datasets in December 2025 and is now working to aggregate all existing datasets previously published in GBIF by Italian institutions. The objective is to reorganize Italian data production and publication efforts to better support publishers and ensure the creation of high-quality datasets.
