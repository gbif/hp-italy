Joining GBIF Italia means being part of an active network of data publishers which agree on the principles of open science. We aim at making data <a href="open_fair"><b>Open</b> and <b>FAIR</b></a> and available worldwide, so that they can be reused for reaearch, discovery and education.
<br><br>
To join the national network of data publishers, you need to <a href="https://www.gbif.org/become-a-publisher" target="_blank">register as a piublisher in the GBIF</a>. You will then be endorsed by the National Node.
<br><br>
After being endorsed, you will be able to publish your dataset with the support of the personnel of the National Node, which will assist thoughout all the process.
<br><br>
In the Documentation section of this portal you'll find some guides on how to prepare and publish your datasets.
